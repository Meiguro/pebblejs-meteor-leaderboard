# Leaderboard using Meteor + Pebble.js

A Pebble.js example companion app for the Meteor leaderboard example.

## Getting Started

1. [Create a meteor leaderboard example](https://www.meteor.com/examples/leaderboard)

1. Create a Pebble.js leaderboard example using [CloudPebble]:

  1. Visit [CloudPebble] and Sign In or Sign Up.
  1. In the [Projects tab](https://cloudpebble.net/ide/), press Import at the top right.
  1. Choose Import from Github.
  1. Pick a Project Name such as "Meteor Leaderboard".
  1. Set the Github Project to this repository: github.com/Meiguro/pebblejs-meteor-leaderboard
  1. Press Import

1. Specify the url to your Meteor leaderboard site in config.js. Press "config.js" under Source Files to do so.

  At the moment, Meteor in Pebble.js has trouble with meteor.com deployed sites, but using your development site should work. Make sure your development machine and phone are in the same network.

1. Under the compilation, select your phone and hit "Install and Run". The demo should now load on your watch.

1. Vote your favorite scientist by pressing select and start hacking!
